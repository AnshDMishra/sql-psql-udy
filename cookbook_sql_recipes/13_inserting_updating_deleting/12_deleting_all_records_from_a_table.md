# Deleting All Records from a Table

You want to delete all the records from a table.

## Problem

Suppose we have the following table:

```console
SELECT * FROM emp_2;

empno | ename  |    job    | mgr  |  hiredate  | sal  | comm | deptno
-------+--------+-----------+------+------------+------+------+--------
 7654 | MARTIN | SALESMAN  | 7698 | 2006-09-28 | 1250 | 1400 |     30

 7934 | MILLER | CLERK     | 7782 | 2007-01-23 | 1300 |  100 |     10
```

You want to delete all records from emp_2;

```console
cookbook=# SELECT * FROM emp_2;
 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```

## Solution

Use the `DELETE` command to delete records from a table. For example, to delete all records from `EMP`, use the following:

- **Solution 1**:

```SQL
DELETE FROM emp_2;
```

- **Solution 2**:

Use the `TRUNCATE` command:

```SQL
TRUNCATE TABLE emp_2;
```

## Discussion

When using the `DELETE` command without a `WHERE` clause, you will delete all rows from the table specified. Sometimes `TRUNCATE`, which applies to tables and therefore doesnâ€™t use the `WHERE` clause, **is preferred as it is faster**.
