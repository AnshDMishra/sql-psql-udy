# Z-score and QQ-Plot

Say we have a `film` table, (`dvdrental` sample database):

In lesson [desc_stats](./00_desc_stats.md), we summarized the main descriptive statics to analyse the duration of movies in the `film` table of the `dvdrental` sample database.

```console
median |  mean  | sample_std | sample_skeweness | sample_kurt
-------+--------+------------+------------------+-------------
   114 | 115.27 |      40.43 |             0.03 |       -1.17
```

The findings of the median, mean and skeweness describe an approximately symmetric distribution, (the mean is closed to the median and the sample skeweness indicates a distribution a bit skewed to the right but almost symmetric). The excess of kurtosis indicates an almost flat distribution compared to the normal distribution.

## Problem

Calculate and plot the z-score of the length variable.

```console

Non-normal distributions can be transformed into sets of Z-scores. In this case the standard normal table cannot be consulted, since the shape of the distribution of Z-scores is the same as that for the original non-normal distribution.

Histogram of a sample from a uniform distribution â€“ it looks multimodal and supposedly roughly symmetric.


## Problem 2

We want to generate a table to plot the normal probability plot or `Q-Q Plot`.

The normal probability plot is a plot used to assess the normal distribution of any numerical data.

If the data follow a normal distribution then a normal probability plot of the theoretical percentiles of the normal distribution on the x-axis versus the observed sample percentiles on the y-axis should be approximately linear.

The theoretical p% percentile of a normal distribution is the value such that p% of the values are lower than that value.

The sample p% percentile of any numerical data is the value such that p% of the measurements fall below that value.

For example, the 50% percentile or the median is the value so that 50% or half of your measurements fall below that value.

We want to generate the following table:

```console
q_plot |   z
-------+-------
0.0005 | -3.27
0.0015 | -2.96
0.0025 | -2.81
0.0035 | -2.70
0.0045 | -2.61
0.0055 | -2.54
0.0065 | -2.48
0.0075 | -2.43
0.0085 | -2.38
0.0095 | -2.34
0.0105 | -2.30
0.0115 | -2.27
0.0125 | -2.24
0.0135 | -2.21
0.0145 | -2.18
0.0155 | -2.15
0.0165 | -2.13
```

Where the first column `q_plot` is the sample quantile plot, and the second column is the normal z-score value corresponding to the `q_plot` value. In other words is the inverse function of the `pnorm` function. It's usually referred to `qnorm` function. The `qnorm` function takes as input the `CDF` value of the normal standard, usually referred as `quantile` or `q` and returns the corresponding `z-score` value. For example, the z-score value of `0.5` is `z=0`.

Plot the normal probability plot :

![qq_plot film length](./images/0_qq_plot_film_length.png)

Normal probability plot of a sample from a uniform distribution â€“ it has an S shape.

## Solution

Hereâ€™s the SQL for calculating z-scores for the length variable in the film table.

```SQL
WITH mean_std AS (
  SELECT ROUND(AVG(length),2) AS mu
       , ROUND(STDDEV(length),2) AS sigma
    FROM film
),
standardz AS (
  SELECT  length AS x
        , (length - mu)/sigma AS zscore
    FROM film f, mean_std m
),
freq AS (
  SELECT  ROUND(zscore::NUMERIC,1) AS zscore
        , COUNT(1) AS cont
    FROM standardz
   GROUP BY 1
),
histogram AS (
  SELECT  *
        , ROUND(1000.0*cont/SUM(cont) OVER(),1)::INTEGER AS freq
    FROM freq
)
SELECT  *
      , SUM(freq) OVER(ORDER BY zscore)
      , LPAD('*',freq::INTEGER,'*') AS freq_plot
  FROM histogram
 ORDER BY 1;
```

## Plot the Normal Probability Plot


Let's first compute the CDF of the Standard normal distribution in the z-score interval `[-4.0 +4.0]`.

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE normal AS (
  SELECT  -4.0 AS z
        , pnorm(-4.0)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_Fz
        , pnorm(-4.0)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_prev
  UNION ALL
  SELECT  z + 0.01 AS z
        , pnorm(z + 0.01)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_Fz
        , pnorm(z)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_prev
    FROM normal
   WHERE z <= 4.0
)
SELECT q_Fz
     , MIN(z) AS min_z
     , MAX(z) AS max_z
     , MIN(q_prev) AS min_q_prev
     , CASE WHEN q_Fz = 0.0000
            THEN '[' || q_Fz::TEXT || ']'
            ELSE '(' || MIN(q_prev)::TEXT || ' '||  q_Fz::TEXT || ']'
       END AS q_class
     , MAX(z)::TEXT AS z
 FROM normal
GROUP BY q_Fz
ORDER BY q_Fz;
```

```console
q_fz   | min_z | max_z | min_q_prev |     q_class     |   z
-------+-------+-------+------------+-----------------+-------

```

Compute the the q values of the normal probability plot in the `film` table for the length variable.


```SQL
WITH ranking AS (
  SELECT  length AS x
        , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY length) AS rnk
        , COUNT(length) OVER() AS n
    FROM film
),
plot_val AS (
  SELECT  x
        , ROUND((rnk - 0.5)/n,4) AS q_plot
    FROM ranking
)
SELECT  x
      , q_plot
  FROM plot_val
 ORDER BY x DESC;
```

1. Assign a rank to each value of your data.

- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY length) AS rnk`

2. Calculate the cumulative probability (pi) associated with each rank (i) using the following formula:

```console
pi=(rnk-a)/(n+1-2a)

Where:

rnk = 1,2,3,â€¦..n. n is the number of data points.

a = 3/8 for n â‰¤ 10, and = 0.5 for n > 10.
```

- `ROUND((rnk - 0.5)/n,4) AS q_plot`.

3. Finds the normal standard Z-score that is associated with each q_plot value.

```console
x   | q_plot
----+--------
46  | 0.0005
46  | 0.0015
46  | 0.0025
46  | 0.0035
46  | 0.0045
47  | 0.0055
47  | 0.0065
47  | 0.0075
47  | 0.0085
47  | 0.0095
47  | 0.0105
47  | 0.0115
48  | 0.0125
..  | ..
185 | 0.9905
```

Let's join the two tables to find out the corresponding z-values.

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE normal AS (
  SELECT  -4.0 AS z
        , pnorm(-4.0)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_Fz
        , pnorm(-4.0)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_prev
  UNION ALL
  SELECT  z + 0.01 AS z
        , pnorm(z + 0.01)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_Fz
        , pnorm(z)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_prev
    FROM normal
   WHERE z <= 4.0
),
z_normal_score AS (
  SELECT q_Fz
       , MIN(z) AS min_z
       , MAX(z) AS max_z
       , MIN(q_prev) AS min_q_prev
       , CASE WHEN q_Fz = 0.0000
              THEN '[' || q_Fz::TEXT || ']'
              ELSE '(' || MIN(q_prev)::TEXT || ' '||  q_Fz::TEXT || ']'
         END AS q_class
       , MAX(z)::TEXT AS z
   FROM normal
  GROUP BY q_Fz
),
ranking AS (
  SELECT  length AS x
        , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY length) AS rnk
        , COUNT(length) OVER() AS n
    FROM film
),
plot_val AS (
  SELECT  x
        , ROUND((rnk - 0.5)/n,4) AS q_plot
    FROM ranking
)
SELECT  pv.q_plot AS q_plot
      , zns.z AS z
  FROM plot_val pv
  LEFT JOIN z_normal_score zns
    ON pv.q_plot > zns.min_q_prev AND pv.q_plot <= zns.q_Fz;  
```

```console
q_plot |   z
-------+-------
0.0005 | -3.27
0.0015 | -2.96
0.0025 | -2.81
0.0035 | -2.70
0.0045 | -2.61
0.0055 | -2.54
0.0065 | -2.48
0.0075 | -2.43
0.0085 | -2.38
0.0095 | -2.34
0.0105 | -2.30
0.0115 | -2.27
0.0125 | -2.24
0.0135 | -2.21
0.0145 | -2.18
0.0155 | -2.15
0.0165 | -2.13
```

Now, let's export the result as a csv file.

```SQL
CREATE VIEW film_normal_prob_plot AS (
WITH RECURSIVE normal AS (
  SELECT  -4.0 AS z
        , pnorm(-4.0)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_Fz
        , pnorm(-4.0)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_prev
  UNION ALL
  SELECT  z + 0.01 AS z
        , pnorm(z + 0.01)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_Fz
        , pnorm(z)::NUMERIC(5,4) AS q_prev
    FROM normal
   WHERE z <= 4.0
),
z_normal_score AS (
  SELECT q_Fz
       , MIN(z) AS min_z
       , MAX(z) AS max_z
       , MIN(q_prev) AS min_q_prev
       , CASE WHEN q_Fz = 0.0000
              THEN '[' || q_Fz::TEXT || ']'
              ELSE '(' || MIN(q_prev)::TEXT || ' '||  q_Fz::TEXT || ']'
         END AS q_class
       , MAX(z)::TEXT AS z
   FROM normal
  GROUP BY q_Fz
),
ranking AS (
  SELECT  length AS x
        , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY length) AS rnk
        , COUNT(length) OVER() AS n
    FROM film
),
plot_val AS (
  SELECT  x
        , ROUND((rnk - 0.5)/n,4) AS q_plot
    FROM ranking
)
SELECT  pv.q_plot AS q_plot
      , zns.z AS z
  FROM plot_val pv
  LEFT JOIN z_normal_score zns
    ON pv.q_plot > zns.min_q_prev AND pv.q_plot <= zns.q_Fz
);
```

Let's export the query as csv file:

```console
dvdrental=# COPY (SELECT * FROM film_normal_prob_plot ORDER BY q_plot) TO 'your_path/film_length_normal_plot.csv' DELIMITER ',' QUOTE ' ' CSV;
COPY 1000
```

Plotting the `qq-plot`:
