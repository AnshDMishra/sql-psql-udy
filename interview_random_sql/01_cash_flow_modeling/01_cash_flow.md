# Cash Flow Modeling SQL

Suppose we have the following table `transactions`:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  month DATE,
  cash_on_hand_ob NUMERIC(9,2),
  revenue NUMERIC(9,2),
  fixed_costs NUMERIC(9,2),
  variable_costs NUMERIC(9,2),
  cash_on_hand_cb NUMERIC(9,2)
);
```

The data in this table are:

```SQL
INSERT INTO transactions
       (month, cash_on_hand_ob, revenue, fixed_costs, variable_costs, cash_on_hand_cb)

Given a set of past or projected cash flows and an opening balance, we want to calculate the `closing` and `opening balance` for each period.

The **Closing Balance (CB)** will be equal to the `Opening Balance (OB)` plus `Revenue`, less the `Fixed Costs` and the `Variable Costs`:

```console
CB = OB + Revenue - Fixed_Costs - Variable_Costs
CB = OB + (change in balance)

change in balance = Revenue - fixed_Costs - Variable_costs
```

The **Opening Balance (OB)** will be equal to the previous period’s `Closing Balance` (CB).

```console
OB = Previous CB
```

We want to return the following table:

```console
month      | cash_on_hand_ob |    revenue    | fixed_costs | variable_costs | cash_on_hand_cb

## Solution

```SQL
WITH chg_tx AS (
  SELECT   t.*
         , (revenue - fixed_costs - variable_costs)::MONEY AS change
    FROM transactions t
),
cumulative_change AS (
  SELECT   month
         , revenue::MONEY
         , fixed_costs::MONEY
         , variable_costs::MONEY
         , MIN(month) OVER() AS first_month
         , SUM(change) OVER(ORDER BY month) AS change
    FROM chg_tx
)
SELECT  cc.month AS month
      , CASE WHEN cc.month = cc.first_month
             THEN t1.initial_ob::MONEY
             ELSE t1.initial_ob::MONEY + LAG(change,1) OVER(ORDER BY cc.month)
        END AS cash_on_hand_ob
      , cc.revenue
      , cc.fixed_costs
      , cc.variable_costs
      , t1.initial_ob::MONEY + change AS cash_on_hand_cb
  FROM (SELECT MAX(cash_on_hand_ob) AS initial_ob
          FROM transactions) t1, cumulative_change cc;
```

## Discussion

Let’s start by calculating change in balance:

```console
Change = Revenue – Fixed Costs – Variable Costs
```

```SQL
SELECT (revenue - fixed_costs - variable_costs)::MONEY AS change
  FROM transactions;  
```

```console
change
---------------
-$150,000.00
-$142,500.00
-$133,875.00
-$123,956.00
-$112,549.00
-$99,432.00
-$84,347.00
-$66,999.00
-$1,164.00
$28,662.00
$62,961.00
$102,405.00
$108,274.00
$184,514.00
$272,192.00
$373,021.00
$488,974.00
$568,513.00
$713,791.00
$880,859.00
$1,072,989.00
$1,293,936.00
$1,548,027.00
$1,840,231.00
(24 rows)
```

Next, we want to calculate the cumulative of this number.

```SQL
WITH chg_tx AS (
  SELECT   month
         , (revenue - fixed_costs - variable_costs)::MONEY AS change
    FROM transactions
)
SELECT   month
       , SUM(change) OVER(ORDER BY month)
  FROM chg_tx;  
```

```console
month      |      sum
-----------+---------------
2016-01-01 |  -$150,000.00
2016-02-01 |  -$292,500.00
2016-03-01 |  -$426,375.00
2016-04-01 |  -$550,331.00
2016-05-01 |  -$662,880.00
2016-06-01 |  -$762,312.00
2016-07-01 |  -$846,659.00
2016-08-01 |  -$913,658.00
2016-09-01 |  -$914,822.00
2016-10-01 |  -$886,160.00
2016-11-01 |  -$823,199.00
2016-12-01 |  -$720,794.00
2017-01-01 |  -$612,520.00
2017-02-01 |  -$428,006.00
2017-03-01 |  -$155,814.00
2017-04-01 |   $217,207.00
2017-05-01 |   $706,181.00
2017-06-01 | $1,274,694.00
2017-07-01 | $1,988,485.00
2017-08-01 | $2,869,344.00
2017-09-01 | $3,942,333.00
2017-10-01 | $5,236,269.00
2017-11-01 | $6,784,296.00
2017-12-01 | $8,624,527.00
(24 rows)
```

Now that we’ve got the `cumulative change` for each period, we’ll add that change to the `opening balance` to get the `closing balance`.

The **closing balance** for each period is calculated as the `initial opening balance` plus the `change each period`.

The opening balance for each period is calculated as the `initial opening balance` plus the `cumulative change` in the last period.

         , SUM(change) OVER(ORDER BY month) AS change
    FROM chg_tx
)
SELECT  cc.month AS month
      , CASE WHEN cc.month = cc.first_month
             THEN t1.initial_ob::MONEY
             ELSE t1.initial_ob::MONEY + LAG(change,1) OVER(ORDER BY cc.month)
        END AS cash_on_hand_ob
      , cc.revenue
      , cc.fixed_costs
      , cc.variable_costs
      , t1.initial_ob::MONEY + change AS cash_on_hand_cb
  FROM (SELECT MAX(cash_on_hand_ob) AS initial_ob
          FROM transactions) t1, cumulative_change cc;
```
