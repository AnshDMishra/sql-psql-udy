# Intro to SQL and PostgreSQL

Hi developers, Data analysts and Data Scientists :smile: !

Welcome to the course of **SQL & PostgreSQL**  :elephant: :wave:

This course is the result of personal notes and collection of various sources. The main reference is the official PostgresSQL [manual](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/), but it also includes notes from Udacity course on [SQL for Data analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198) and the book [A Visual Introduction to SQL](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Introduction-SQL-David-Chappell/dp/0471412767).

This repo is only a preliminary version of the course but I'll soon organise the chapters for a more systematic approach. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts about Relational Data Bases and SQL that will be addressed in later chapters. I'll recall these concepts over and over again in order to reinforce them.

The innovative part is the **Visual approach adopted in the course**. By **diagramming each query**, this course resolves the language's apparent complexity into simple clarity using intuitive visual representation.

I hope you will enjoy this learning experience :smile:.

I appreciate any suggestion to improve the quality of these notes and above all it would be nice to :star: this repo or become one of my followers :smile:.

**HAPPY LEARNING !**
