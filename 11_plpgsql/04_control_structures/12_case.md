# Pl/PgSQL CASE Statement

Besides the `if` statement, PostgreSQL provides you with `case` **statements** that **allow you to execute a block of code based on a condition**.

The `case statement` selects a when section **to execute from a list of when sections based on a condition**.

The case statement has two forms:

- **Simple case statement**
- **Searched case statement**

> Notice that you should not confuse about the `case statement` and `case expression`. The case expression evaluates to a value while the case statement selects a section to execute based on condition.

## Simple case statement

Letâ€™s start with the syntax of the **simple case** statement:

```SQL
case search-expression
   when expression_1 [, expression_2, ...] then
      when-statements
  [ ... ]
  [else
      else-statements ]
END case;
```

The `search-expression` is an expression that evaluates to a result.

The `case` statement **compares the result of the** `search-expression` with the `expression` **in each when branch using equal operator** (`=`) from top to bottom.

If the `case` statement **finds a match**, it will execute the corresponding when section. Also, it stops comparing the result of the `search-expression` with the remaining expressions.

If the `case` statement cannot find any match, it will execute the `else` section.

The `else` section is **optional**. If the result of the `search-expression` does not match expression in the `when` sections and the `else` section does not exist, the `case` statement will raise a `case_not_found` exception.

The following is an example of the simple case statement.

```SQL
do $$
declare
	rate   film.rental_rate%type;
	price_segment varchar(50);
begin
    -- get the rental rate
    select rental_rate into rate
    from film
    where film_id = 100;

	-- assign the price segment
	if found then
		case rate
		   when 0.99 then
              price_segment =  'Mass';
		   when 2.99 then
              price_segment = 'Mainstream';
		   when 4.99 then
              price_segment = 'High End';
		   else
	    	  price_segment = 'Unspecified';
		   end case;
		raise notice '%', price_segment;  
    end if;
end; $$
```

Output:

```console
NOTICE:  High End
```

This example first selects the film with id `100`. Based on the rental rate, it assigns a price segment to the film that can be mass, mainstream, or high end. In case the price is not 0.99, 2.99 or 4.99, the `case` statement assigns the film the price segment as unspecified.

The following flowchart illustrates the simple `case` statement in this example:

## Searched case statement

The following syntax shows syntax of the `searched case` statement:

```SQL
case
    when boolean-expression-1 then
      statements
  [ when boolean-expression-2 then
      statements
    ... ]
  [ else
      statements ]
end case;
```

In this syntax, the `case` statement **evaluates the boolean expressions sequentially from top to bottom** until it finds an expression that evaluates to `true`

Once it finds an expression that evaluates to `true`, the `case` statement executes the corresponding when section and immediately stops searching for the remaining expressions.

In case no expression evaluates to `true`, the case statement will execute the the `else` section.

The `else` section is optional. If you omit the else section and there is no expression evaluates to `true`, the case statement will raise the `case_not_found` exception.

The following example illustrates how to use a simple `case` statement:

```SQL
do $$
declare
    total_payment numeric;
    service_level varchar(25) ;
begin
     select sum(amount) into total_payment
     from Payment
     where customer_id = 100;

	 if found then
	    case
		   when total_payment > 200 then
               service_level = 'Platinum' ;
           when total_payment > 100 then
	           service_level = 'Gold' ;
           else
               service_level = 'Silver' ;
        end case;
		raise notice 'Service Level: %', service_level;
     else
	    raise notice 'Customer not found';
	 end if;
end; $$
```

How it works:

- First, select the total payment paid by the customer id `100` from the payment table.
- Then, assign the `service` level to the customer based on the total payment

The following diagram illustrates the logic:

Notice that the `searched case` statement is similar to the `if then elsif` statement.
