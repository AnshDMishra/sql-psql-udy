# IF Statement

The `if` statement determines which statements to execute based on the result of a boolean expression.

PL/pgSQL provides you with **three forms** of the `if statements`.

- `if then`
- `if then else`
- `if then elsif`

## PL/pgSQL if-then statement

The following illustrates the simplest form of the `if` statement:

```SQL
if condition then
   statements;
end if;
```

The `if` statement executes `statements` if a condition is **true**. If the condition evaluates to **false**, the control is passed to the next statement after the `END if` part.

The `condition` is a boolean expression that evaluates to **true** or **false**.

The `statements` can be one or more statements that will be executed if the condition is true. It can be any valid statement, even another if statement.

When an `if` statement is placed inside another `if` statement, it is called a `nested-if` statement.

The following flowchart illustrates the simple `if` statement.

See the following example:

```SQL
do $$
declare
  selected_film film%rowtype;
  input_film_id film.film_id%type := 0;
begin  

  select * from film
  into selected_film
  where film_id = input_film_id;

  if not found then
     raise notice'The film % could not be found',
	    input_film_id;
  end if;
end $$
```

In this example, we selected a `film` by a specific film id (`0`).

The **found** is a `global variable` that is **available** in `PL/pgSQL` procedure language. If the `select into` statement sets the **found** variable **if a row is assigned** or `false` **if no row is returned**.

We used the `if` statement to check if the film with id (`0`) **exists and raise a notice if it does not**.

```console
ERROR:  The film 0 could not be found
```

If you change the value of the `input_film_id` variable to some value that exists in the film table like `100`, you will not see any message.

## PL/pgSQL if-then-else statement

The following illustrates the syntax of the `if-then-else` statement:

```SQL
if condition then
  statements;
else
  alternative-statements;
END if;
```

The `if then else` statement executes the statements in the `if` branch if the condition evaluates to **true**; `otherwise`, **it executes the statements in the** `else` branch.

The following flowchart illustrates the if else statement.

![ifelse](./images/01_if_else.png)

See the following example:

```SQL
do $$
declare
  selected_film film%rowtype;
  input_film_id film.film_id%type := 100;
begin  

  select * from film
  into selected_film
  where film_id = input_film_id;

  if not found then
     raise notice 'The film % could not be found',
	    input_film_id;
  else
     raise notice 'The film title is %', selected_film.title;
  end if;
end $$
```

In this example, the film id `100` exists in the film table so that the `FOUND` variable was set to **true**. Therefore, the statement in the else branch executed.

Here is the output:

```console
NOTICE:  The film title is Brooklyn Desert
```

## PL/pgSQL if-then-elsif Statement

The following illustrates the syntax of the `if then elsif` statement:

```SQL
if condition_1 then
  statement_1;
elsif condition_2 then
  statement_2
...
elsif condition_n then
  statement_n;
else
  else-statement;
end if;
```

The `if` and `ifthen else` statements evaluate **one condition**. However, the `if then elsif` **statement evaluates multiple conditions**.

If a condition is **true**, the corresponding statement in that branch is executed.

For example, if the `condition_1` is **true** then the `if then ELSif` **executes** the `statement_1` and **stops evaluating the other conditions**.

If **all conditions evaluate to** `false`, the `if then elsif` **executes the statements in the else branch**.

The following flowchart illustrates the `if then elsif` statement:

![ifelse](./images/03_if_elseif.png)

Letâ€™s look at the following example:

```SQL
do $$
declare
   v_film film%rowtype;
   len_description varchar(100);
begin  

  select * from film
  into v_film
  where film_id = 100;

  if not found then
     raise notice 'Film not found';
  else
      if v_film.length >0 and v_film.length <= 50 then
		 len_description := 'Short';
	  elsif v_film.length > 50 and v_film.length < 120 then
		 len_description := 'Medium';
	  elsif v_film.length > 120 then
		 len_description := 'Long';
	  else
		 len_description := 'N/A';
	  end if;

	  raise notice 'The % film is %.',
	     v_film.title,  
	     len_description;
  end if;
end $$
```

How it works:

- First, select the film with id `100`. If the film does not exist, raise a notice that the film is not found.
- Second, use the `if then elsif` statement to assign the film a description based on the length of the film.

## Summary
- Use the `if then` to execute statements when a condition is true.
- Use the `if then else` to execute statements when a condition is true and execute other statements when the condition is false.
- Use the `if then elsif` to evaluate multiple conditions and execute statements when the corresponding condition is true.
