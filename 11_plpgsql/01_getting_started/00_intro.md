# Introduction

This chapter shows you step by step how to use the `PL/pgSQL` to develop PostgreSQL **user-defined functions** and **stored procedures**.

**PL/pgSQL procedural** language adds many procedural elements, e.g., control structures, loops, and complex computations, to extend standard SQL. It allows you to develop **complex functions and stored procedures in PostgreSQL** that may not be possible using plain SQL.

PL/pgSQL procedural language is similar to the Oracle PL/SQL. The following are reasons to learn PL/pgSQL:

- `PL/pgSQL` is easy to learn and simple to use.
- `PL/pgSQL` comes with PostgreSQL by default. The **user-defined functions** and **stored procedures** developed in PL/pgSQL can be used like any `built-in` functions and `stored procedures`.
- `PL/pgSQL` **inherits all user-defined types, functions, and operators**.
- `PL/pgSQL` has many features that allow you to develop complex functions and stored procedures.
- `PL/pgSQL` can be defined to be trusted by the PostgreSQL database server.

Letâ€™s get started programming with PL/pgSQL.
