# ALTER TRIGGER

The `ALTER TRIGGER` statement allows you to rename a trigger. The following shows the syntax of the `ALTER TRIGGER` statement:

```SQL
ALTER TRIGGER trigger_name
ON table_name
RENAME TO new_trigger_name;
```

In this syntax:

- First, specify the `name` of the trigger that you want to **rename** after the `ALTER TRIGGER` keyword.
- Second, specify the `name` of the table associated with the trigger after the `ON` keyword.
- Third, specify the `new name` of the trigger after the `RENAME TO` keyword.

## PostgreSQL ALTER TRIGGER example

First, create new table called `employees`:

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;

CREATE TABLE employees(
   employee_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   salary decimal(11,2) not null default 0,
   PRIMARY KEY(employee_id)
);
```

Second, create a function that raises an exception if the new salary is greater than the old one 100%:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_salary()
  RETURNS TRIGGER
  LANGUAGE PLPGSQL  
  AS
$$
BEGIN
	IF (NEW.salary - OLD.salary) / OLD.salary >= 1 THEN
		RAISE 'The salary increment cannot that high.';
	END IF;

	RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
```

Third, create a `before update trigger` that executes the `check_salary()` function before updating the salary.

```SQL
CREATE TRIGGER before_update_salary
  BEFORE UPDATE
  ON employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_salary();
```

Fourth, insert a new row into the `employees` table:

```SQL
INSERT INTO employees(first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES('John','Doe',100000);
```

Fifth, update the salary of the employee id 1:

```SQL
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 200000
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

The trigger was fired and issued the following error:

```SQL
ERROR:  The salary increment cannot that high.
CONTEXT:  PL/pgSQL function check_salary() line 4 at RAISE
SQL state: P0001
```

It works as expected.

Finally, use the `ALTER TRIGGER` statement to rename the `before_update_salary` trigger to `salary_before_update`:

```SQL
ALTER TRIGGER before_update_salary
ON employees
RENAME TO salary_before_update;
```

If you use psql tool, you can view all triggers associated with a table using the `\dS` command.

## Replacing triggers

PostgreSQL doesnâ€™t support the `OR REPLACE` statement that allows you to modify the trigger definition like the function that will be executed when the trigger is fired.

In order to do so, you can use the `DROP TRIGGER` and `CREATE TRIGGER` statements. You can also wrap these statements in a transaction.

The following example illustrates how to change the `check_salary` function of the `salary_before_update` trigger to `validate_salary`:

```SQL
BEGIN;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS salary_before_update;

CREATE TRIGGER salary_before_udpate
  BEFORE UPDATE
  ON employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE validate_salary();

COMMIT;
```
