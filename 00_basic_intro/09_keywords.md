# Keywords

Like many computer languages, SQL reserves certain words for its own use. These words, called *reserved words** or **keywords**, **may not be used as the name of a table**, as a name for one of a table's **columns**, or for anything else. They always have only the meaning assigned to them by SQL.

For a full list of the **keywords** reserved by PostgreSql please refer to the documentation on [line](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html).
