# Introducing SQL

Storing and retrieving information - working with databases - is at the heart of how computers are used today. Databases contain information about people, policies, parts, and a plethora of other things. To make it easier to work with this information, we use software called a **data base management system** (**DBMS**).

A typical **DBMS** allows its users to store, modify, and access data in an organized, efficient way.

Once information has been stored in a DBMS, the next problem is to provide some way to access and work with that information. The most common way to do this is to create a language of some kind that allows users to get at the data in a database.

Access to a database is often called a **query**, and so a language that allows this is called a **query language**.

While many query languages have been created for various DBMSs, one has become dominant. That language is officially called **Structured Query Language**, but it's more commonly known by its acronym: **SQL**. (To make things still more confusing, it's pronounced "sequel", as if the acronym contained vowels :smile:).

Today, **SQL** has become the standard database query language, one that's supported by a great many DBMSs.
