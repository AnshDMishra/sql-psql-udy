# Example Databases

As described earlier, a relational database is just a collection of tables. Each table has some number of columns, and contains rows (or records) with the actual information. Each SQL query access the data stored in some particular database.

Throughout this course, we will use two examples databases.

- **Parch & Posey**: This database contains the information for a fictitious company that **sells paper**. For a discussion of the tables in this database please refer to this lesson [01_intro](../01_basic_sql/01_intro.md) and [02_erd](../01_basic_sql/02_erd.md). For the creation of the Parch and Posey database please refer to this lesson [05_parch_posey](../00_psql_setup/05_parch_posey.md).
- **UniY**: This database contains the registration information for a fictitious (and very small) university.


Each table contains a related set of information, described by that table's column names. Each column contains information of a certain type, drawn from the list of possible types described earlier.

In the next lessons we'll describe the tables in the **UniY** database.
