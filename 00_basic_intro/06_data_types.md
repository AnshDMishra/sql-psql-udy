# Data Types

Relational databases store data. Every element of that stored data must be of some **type**. Most generally,a

- **type** can be thought of as just a **well-defined group of values**.

A familiar example is the type *integer*, whose values are whole numbers such as 42 and -1.

In every table, each `column` (and thus every field in every record) **stores only data of a certain type**.

SQL precisely defines the data types that can be stored in its tables. As with other parts of the language, however, the types supported by different SQL systems vary. Those defined by the **ISO/ANSI** standard are listed below.

| DATA TYPE | DESCRPTION|
|:----------| :---------|
|**CHARACTER**| Fixed-length character data|
|**CHARACTER VARYING**| Variable-length character data|
|**NUMERIC**| Decimal numbers|
|**DECIMAL**| Decimal numbers|
|**INTEGER**| Integer numbers|
|**SMALLINT**| Small integer numbers|
|**BIT**| Fixed-length bit string|
|**BIT VARYING**| Variable-length bit string|
|**FLOAT**| Floating point numbers|
|**REAL**| Low-precision floating point numbers|
|**DOUBLE PRECISION**| High-precision floating point numbers|
|**DATE**| Calendar date|
|**TIME**| Clock time|
|**TIMESTAMP**| Date and time|
|**INTERVAL**| Time interval|
