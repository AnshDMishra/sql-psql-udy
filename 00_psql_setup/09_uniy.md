# UniY Sample Database

In this lesson we create a new database called `uniy`. To create and populate the tables in the `uniy` database we'll create an sql file named `uniy.sql` and then execute the sql script as we did for the `parch-and-posey.sql`. However, this time we'll  show how to implement the **uniY's ERD** from scratch.

In the following sections we'll:

1. **Create** the **uniy** database in PostgreSQLSql.
2. **Implement** the **uniy's ERD** in the `uni-db.sql` file.
3. **Execute** the **uniy.sql** file to create and populate the uniy's tables.
