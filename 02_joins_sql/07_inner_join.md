# Joining Tables Using the JOIN Operator

In the inital versions of the SQL language, joins could only be created using the `WHERE` clause, and this syntax is still supported in SQL-92. This newer version, however, also introduces a new explicit **JOIN** `operator`.


## PostgreSQL joins

PostgreSQL join is used to combine columns from one (`self-join`) or more tables based on the values of the common columns between related tables. The common columns are typically the primary key columns of the first table and foreign key columns of the second table.

PostgreSQL supports `inner join`, `left join`, `right join`, `full outer join`, `cross join`, `natural join`, and a special kind of join called `self-join`.

In this lesson we introduce the **INNER JOIN** clause.


## PostgreSQL INNER JOIN

To query data from two or more related tables, you use the **INNER JOIN** clause. The following statement illustrates how to join two tables `T1` and `T2`.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2
ON join_predicate;
```

Letâ€™s examine the statement above in detail:

- First, specify the main table in the `FROM` clause, `T1` in this case.
- Second, specify the joined table in the `INNER JOIN` clause followed by the `ON` keyword. The joined table is `T2` in the above statement.
- Third, a `join predicate` specifies the condition for joining tables. **Only rows that satisfy the join predicate are included in the result set**.

The query returns a result set by combining column values of both tables `T1` and `T2` **based on the join predicate**.

It compares each row of table `T1` with rows of table `T2` to find all pairs of rows that satisfy the join predicate. Whenever the **join predicate is satisfied by matching** `non-NULL values`, column values for each matching pair of rows of `T1` and `T2` tables are combined into a row in the result set.

Since the `INNER JOIN` is commutative, the previous query is equivalent to:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM T2 INNER JOIN T1
ON join_predicate;
```


Compare the previous query to the syntax using the `WHERE` clause:

```SQL
SELECT *
  FROM T2, T1
 WHERE join_predicate;
```

The two tables in the example are combined with the operator **INNER JOIN**, and the `WHERE` clause is replaced by an `ON` clause. An **INNER JOIN** is the most common type of join. It returns only those records from each table that match the criteria specified in the `ON` clause.

### Problem 1

1. **Problem**: Which teachers teach which courses? (List the teachers by name and course_id)


- **Tables**: teachers, sections
- **Columns**: teacher_name, course_id
- **Condition**: `teachers.teacher_id = sections.teacher_id`
- **Sorting**: teacher_name, course_id

```console
uniy=# \d sections
                 Table "public.sections"
    Column    |   Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default
--------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------
 course_id    | smallint |           | not null |
 section_id   | smallint |           | not null |
 teacher_id   | smallint |           |          |
 num_students | smallint |           |          |
Indexes:
    "sections_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (course_id, section_id)
Foreign-key constraints:
    "sections_fkey_course" FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
    "sections_fkey_teacher" FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teachers(teacher_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
Referenced by:
    TABLE "enrolls" CONSTRAINT "enrolls_fkey_section" FOREIGN KEY (course_id, section_id) REFERENCES sections(course_id, section_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
