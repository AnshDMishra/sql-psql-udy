# Introduction to PostgreSQL BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN operator

The `BETWEEN` operator is one of the logical operators in SQL. The `BETWEEN` operator **checks if a value is within a range of values**. The `NOT BETWEEN` operator **checks if a value is not within a range of values**.

|  Range  |BOOLEAN OPERATOR| BETWEEN | NOT BETWEEN|
|:--|:---------------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
|**[a , b]**| (`val` >= a) **AND** (`val` <= b) | `val` BETWEEN a AND b | |
|**(-inf, a) U (b, +inf)**| (`val` < a) **OR** (`val` > b) | |`val` NOT BETWEEN a AND b |


## BETWEEN

The syntax of the `BETWEEN` operator is as follows:

```SQL
expression BETWEEN low AND high;
```

In this syntax:

- **A)**: `low` and `high`

The `low` and `high` specify the **lower** and **upper** values of the range to test. The low and high values can be `literals` or `expressions`.

- **B)**: `expression`

Is the expression to test for in the range defined by `low` and `high`. To be able to compare, the **data types of expression**, low, and high **must be the same**.

- **C)**: `AND` operator

The `AND` operator acts as a placeholder to separate between `low` and `high`.

The `BETWEEN` operator returns **true** if the `expression` is greater than or equal to ( **>=**) the `low value` and less than or equal to (**<=**) the `high value`.

Technically, the BETWEEN is the equivalent to the following expression that uses the greater than or equal to (`>=`) and less than or equal to (`<=`) operators:

```SQL
expression >= low AND expression <= high; -- [low high]
expression BETWEEN low AND high;
```

To **compare a value with an exclusive range**, you need to use the comparison operators less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`).

```SQL
expression >= low AND expression <  high; -- [low high)  
expression >  low AND expression <= high; -- (low high]
expression >  low AND expression <  high; -- (low high)  
```

## NOT BETWEEN

To negate the result of the `BETWEEN` operator, you use the `NOT` operator:

```SQL
expression NOT BETWEEN low AND high;
```

The `NOT BETWEEN` returns **true** if the expression is less than low (`< low`) or greater than high `(> high)`; otherwise, it returns false.

Like the `BETWEEN` operator, you can rewrite the `NOT BETWEEN` operator using the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) operators with the `OR` operator as follows:

```SQL
expression < low OR expression > high;
```

In practice, you often use the `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN` operator in the `WHERE` clause of the SELECT to **select rows whose value of a column is within a specific range**.

**Note**: The `NOT BETWEEN` operator allows you to compare a value with an exclusive range of the form:

```SQL
expression < low OR expression > high; -- (-inf low) or (high +inf)
expression NOT BETWEEN low AND high;
```

However, the comparison of a value with other exclusive range intervals requires the use of the comparisons operators:

```SQL
expression <= low OR expression >  high; -- (-inf low] or (high +inf)
expression <  low OR expression >= high; -- (-inf low) or [high +inf)
expression <= low OR expression >= high; -- (-inf low] or [high +inf)
```

# BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN

Using `>=` and `<=` and `AND`, it is possible to select records where values of a specific field in the record fall within a specified range.

In an earlier example, for instance, we listed the name and other information for all students with zip codes from 2000 to 29999 inclusive, (i.e. `(zip >= '20000' AND zip <= '29999')`).

This kind of query arises quite often, and so SQL provides a shorthand way of expressing it. By using `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN` in a `WHERE` clause, we can directly specify renges of values.

The general form is:

```SQL
SELECT <column name>
  FROM <table>
 WHERE <column name> BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>;
```

Equivalent  `AND` form with comparison operators:

```SQL
SELECT <column name>
  FROM <table>
 WHERE <column name> >= <value1> AND
       <column name> <= <value2>;
```

In this case, only those records in which values in `<column name>` aree greater than or equal to `<value1>` and less than or equal to `<value2>` will be selected.

The negative form is also available, as in

```SQL
SELECT <column name>
  FROM <table>
 WHERE <column name> NOT BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>;
```

Equivalent  `OR` form with comparison operators:

```SQL
SELECT <column name>
  FROM <table>
 WHERE <column name> < <value1> OR
       <column name> > <value2>;
```

In this case, only those records whose values are not within the specified range will be selected.

In both forms, `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN`, the two values are assumed to be specified in ascending order. In this case, for example, `<value1>` is less than `<value2>`. If you reverse the order of the values than the `BETWEEN` and `NOT BETWEEN` operators will never return a true value, although PostgreSQL does not warn you about this logical error.

The values specified in the `WHERE` clause can be of any type, but `<value1>` and `<value2>` must both be of a type comparable to that defined for `<column name>`.

For example, this basic example shows what happen when a comparison involves two different types:

```console
hr=# SELECT 'C' BETWEEN 0 AND 100;
ERROR:  invalid input syntax for integer: "C"
LINE 1: SELECT 'C' BETWEEN 0 AND 100;
               ^
hr=# SELECT 'C' BETWEEN 'B' AND 'F';
 ?column?
----------
 t
(1 row)
```

## UniY BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN in a WHERE clause examples

Weâ€™ll use the `teachers` and `students` tables in the `uniy` sample database for the demonstration.

### Numerical examples

1. **Problem**: List the names and salaries of teachers who make between $30,000 and $35,000 a year. Sort the result by salary in descending order.

- **table**: teachers
- **columns**: teacher_name, salary
- **condition**: salary between 30,000 and 35,000 dollars.
- **sorting**: salary DESC.

**Table**
```console
uniy=# \d teachers
                    Table "public.teachers"
    Column    |     Type      | Collation | Nullable | Default
--------------+---------------+-----------+----------+---------
 teacher_id   | smallint      |           | not null |
 teacher_name | character(18) |           |          |
 phone        | character(10) |           |          |
 salary       | numeric(10,2) |           |          |
Indexes:
    "teachers_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (teacher_id)
```

**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT teacher_name,
       salaray
  FROM teachers
 WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

In the SQL statement below I simply added two columns to indicate the salary boolean condition.


**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT teacher_name,
       salary,
       CASE WHEN salary >= 30000 THEN 'TRUE'
            ELSE 'FALSE'
       END AS "salary_>=_30000",
       CASE WHEN salary <= 35000 THEN 'TRUE'
            ELSE 'FALSE'
       END AS "salary_<=_35000"
  FROM teachers
 WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```


**Results**

|teacher_name    |  salary  | `salary_>=_30000` | `salary_<=_35000`|
|:--------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
|Dr. Wright         | 35000.00 | TRUE           | TRUE|
|Dr. Scango         | 32098.00 | TRUE           | TRUE|
|Dr. Olsen          | 31778.00 | TRUE           | TRUE|
|Dr. Lowe           | 31450.00 | TRUE           | TRUE|

As you can see both conditions are `TRUE` in the table above.

**Query**
```console
uniy=# SELECT teacher_name,
uniy-#        salary,
uniy-#        CASE WHEN salary >= 30000 THEN 'TRUE'
uniy-#             ELSE 'FALSE'
uniy-#        END AS "salary_>=_30000",
uniy-#        CASE WHEN salary <= 35000 THEN 'TRUE'
uniy-#             ELSE 'FALSE'
uniy-#        END AS "salary_<=_35000"
uniy-#   FROM teachers
uniy-#  WHERE salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000
uniy-#  ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Output**
```console
    teacher_name    |  salary  | salary_>=_30000 | salary_<=_35000
--------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------
 Dr. Wright         | 35000.00 | TRUE           | TRUE
 Dr. Scango         | 32098.00 | TRUE           | TRUE
 Dr. Olsen          | 31778.00 | TRUE           | TRUE
 Dr. Lowe           | 31450.00 | TRUE           | TRUE
(4 rows)
```

2. **Problem**: List the names and salaries of teachers who make less than $30,000 and more than $35,000 a year. Sort the result by salary in descending order.

- **table**: teachers
- **columns**: teacher_name, salary
- **condition**: salary less than 30,000 and more than 35,000 dollars.
- **sorting**: salary DESC.

**Table**
```console
uniy=# \d teachers
                    Table "public.teachers"
    Column    |     Type      | Collation | Nullable | Default
--------------+---------------+-----------+----------+---------
 teacher_id   | smallint      |           | not null |
 teacher_name | character(18) |           |          |
 phone        | character(10) |           |          |
 salary       | numeric(10,2) |           |          |
Indexes:
    "teachers_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (teacher_id)
```

**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT teacher_name,
       salaray
  FROM teachers
 WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

In the SQL statement below I simply added two columns to indicate the salary boolean condition.

**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT teacher_name,
       salary,
       CASE WHEN salary < 30000 THEN 'TRUE'
            ELSE 'FALSE'
       END AS "salary_<_30000",
       CASE WHEN salary > 35000 THEN 'TRUE'
            ELSE 'FALSE'
       END AS "salary_>_35000"
  FROM teachers
 WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Results**

|teacher_name    |  salary  | `salary_<_30000` | `salary_>_35000`|
|:--------------:|:--------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|Dr. Engle          | 38200.00 | FALSE          | **TRUE**|
|Dr. Cooke          | 29560.00 | **TRUE**           | FALSE|
|Dr. Horn           | 27540.00 | **TRUE**           | FALSE|

As you can see only one condition is `TRUE` in the table above. The first record is in the range of values above the maximum value `35,000` and the remaining records are in the range of values below the minimum value `30,000`.

**Query**
```console
uniy=# SELECT teacher_name,
uniy-#        salary,
uniy-#        CASE WHEN salary < 30000 THEN 'TRUE'
uniy-#             ELSE 'FALSE'
uniy-#        END AS "salary_<_30000",

uniy-#   FROM teachers
uniy-#  WHERE salary NOT BETWEEN 30000 AND 35000
uniy-#  ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Output**
```console

## HR BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN in a WHERE clause examples

Weâ€™ll use the `employees` table in the `hr` sample database for the demonstration.

### Numerical examples

1. **Problem**: List the names and salaries of employees who make a monthly salary in the following ranges of values:
  - `low salary`: less than or equal to  $2,500 or
  - `medium salary`: between $3,000 and $5,000  or
  - `high salary`: between $10,000 and $15,000 or
  - `big salary`: greater than or equal to $20,000.

Sort the result by salary in descending order.

- **table**: employees
- **columns**: employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
- **condition**: salary in `low`, `medium`, `high` and `big` classes of range values.
- **sorting**: salary DESC.

**table**
```console
hr=# \d employees
                                            Table "public.employees"
    Column     |          Type          | Collation | Nullable |                    Default
---------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+------------------------------------------------
 employee_id   | integer                |           | not null | nextval('employees_employee_id_seq'::regclass)
 first_name    | character varying(20)  |           |          |
 last_name     | character varying(25)  |           | not null |
 email         | character varying(100) |           | not null |
 phone_number  | character varying(20)  |           |          |
 hire_date     | date                   |           | not null |
 job_id        | integer                |           | not null |
 salary        | numeric(8,2)           |           | not null |
 manager_id    | integer                |           |          |
 department_id | integer                |           |          |
Indexes:
    "employees_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (employee_id)
```

We first give a verbose solution to the problem using the comparison operators and then a more convenient and readable solution that requires less typing witht the `BETWEEN` operator.


**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT employee_id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       salary
  FROM employees
 WHERE (salary <= 2500) OR
       (salary >= 3000 AND salary <= 5000) OR
       (salary >= 10000 AND salary <= 15000) OR
       (salary >= 20000)
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

Solution using the `BETWEEN` operator.

**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT employee_id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       salary
  FROM employees
 WHERE (salary <= 2500) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000) OR
       (salary >= 20000)
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

In the SQL statement below I simply added a column to indicate the salary range class of the employee.

**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT employee_id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       salary,
       CASE WHEN salary <= 2500 THEN 'Low'
            WHEN salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000 THEN 'Medium'
            WHEN salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000 THEN 'High'
            WHEN salary >= 20000 THEN 'Big'
            ELSE 'Unknown'
       END AS "salary_class"
  FROM employees
 WHERE (salary <= 2500) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000) OR
       (salary >= 20000)
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Salary class**


|salary| s_range|
|:--:|:--|
|Big|`s` **>= 20000**|
|High|**10000 <=** `s` **<= 15000**|
|Medium|**3000 <=** `s` **<= 5000**|
|Low|`s`**<= 2500**|




**Results**

|employee_id | first_name | last_name  |  salary  | salary_class|
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|100 | Steven     | King       | 24000.00 | Big|

2. **Problem**: List the names and salaries of employees who make a monthly salary level in the following ranges of values:
  - `entry level`: above $2,500 and below $3,000 or
  - `professional level`: above $5,000 and below $10,000 or
  - `senior level`: above $15,000 and below $20,000.

Note the word `above` and `below` mean `greater than` and `less than`, respectively. Therefore, an `entry level` salary is a salary greater than $2,500 and less than $3,000.

Sort the result by salary in descending order.

- **table**: employees
- **columns**: employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
- **condition**: salary in `entry`, `professional` and `senior` level job.
- **sorting**: salary DESC.

**table**

Indexes:
    "employees_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (employee_id)
```


**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT employee_id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       salary
  FROM employees
 WHERE NOT (
       (salary <= 2500) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000) OR
       (salary >= 20000))
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```


**Salary class**

|salary| s_range|
|:--:|:--|
|Big|`s` **>= 20000**|
|**Senior**|**15000 <** `s` **< 20000**|
|High|**10000 <=** `s` **<= 15000**|
|**Professional**|**5000 <** `s` **< 10000**|
|Medium|**3000 <=** `s` **<= 5000**|
|**Entry**|**2500 <**`s`**< 3000**|
|Low|`s`**<= 2500**|


We clearly see that the classes `Senior`, `Professional` and `Entry` level indicated in the salary column, identify the complementary intervals of the classes `Big`, `High`, `Medium` and `Low`. Therefore, the SQL query must return the records not included in the previous query. It follows that the SQL query can be easily obtained with the `NOT` operator that negates the result of the query in the earlier exercise.


In the SQL statement below I simply added a column to indicate the salary range class of the employee job experience level.


**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT employee_id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       salary,
       CASE WHEN salary > 2500 AND salary < 3000 THEN 'Entry'
            WHEN salary > 5000 AND salary < 10000 THEN 'Professional'
            WHEN salary > 15000 AND salary < 20000 THEN 'Senior'
            ELSE 'other'
       END AS "salary_level"
  FROM employees
 WHERE NOT (
       (salary <= 2500) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000) OR
       (salary BETWEEN 10000 AND 15000) OR
       (salary >= 20000))
 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

## DVDRENTAL BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN in a WHERE clause examples

Weâ€™ll use the `rental` table in the `dvdrental` sample database for the demonstration.

1. **Problem**: Find all customers who rented a dvd for more than 9 days in the weekends after 11 pm. Sort the result by day of the week and rental date time of the day (hours).

- **table**: employees
- **columns**: employee_id, rental_date
- **condition**: rented a dvd for more than 9 days in the weekends after 11 pm.
- **sorting**: day of the week ASC, hours ASC.


**Table**
```console
dvdrental=# \d rental
                                             Table "public.rental"
    Column    |            Type             | Collation | Nullable |                  Default
--------------+-----------------------------+-----------+----------+-------------------------------------------
 rental_id    | integer                     |           | not null | nextval('rental_rental_id_seq'::regclass)
 rental_date  | timestamp without time zone |           | not null |
 inventory_id | integer                     |           | not null |
 customer_id  | smallint                    |           | not null |
 return_date  | timestamp without time zone |           |          |
 staff_id     | smallint                    |           | not null |
 last_update  | timestamp without time zone |           | not null | now()
Indexes:
    "rental_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (rental_id)
```

**SQL**
```SQL
SELECT customer_id,
       rental_date,
       CASE WHEN EXTRACT (DOW FROM rental_date) = 0 THEN 'Sunday'
            WHEN EXTRACT (DOW FROM rental_date) = 6 THEN 'Saturday'
            ELSE 'Other'
       END AS "dow",
       EXTRACT (HOUR FROM rental_date) AS "hour"
  FROM rental
 WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM (return_date - rental_date)) < 1 AND
       EXTRACT (DAY FROM (return_date - rental_date)) >= 9 AND
       EXTRACT (DOW FROM rental_date) NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 5 AND
       EXTRACT (HOUR FROM rental_date) BETWEEN 22 AND 23
 ORDER BY dow, hour;
```

We used the function `EXTRACT` to convert the number of days in the timeinterval `(return_date - rental_date)` and the `DOW` for the day of the week.

**Results**
