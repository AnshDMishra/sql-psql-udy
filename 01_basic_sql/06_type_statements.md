# Types of statements

The SQL language has a few different elements. The most basic of which is a **statement**.

Think of a **statement** as simple a piece of **correctly written SQL code**.

- **STATEMENT**: Tell the Database What you want to do with the Data.

- **CREATE TABLE**: Is How you make a new Table in the Database.

- **DROP TABLE**: Is How You Remove a Table from the Database.

In this lesson, we'll focus on the **SELECT** statement.

- **SELECT**: Allows you to read and display Data.

SELECT statements are commonly referred as **Queries**. There are a few other types of statements that SQL understand. They all have different functions, most of which relate to the creation and removal of data. Eventually, you'll learn how to do that, but the majority of analytical work doesn't involve adding, removing, or modifying data within a database.

It requires reading data and manipulating it, but only occasionally updating the underlaying source.

## Summary

The key to SQL is understanding statements. A few statements include:

- **CREATE TABLE** is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
- **DROP TABLE** is a statement that removes a table in a database.
- **SELECT** allows you to read data and display it. This is called a query.

The SELECT statement is the common statement used by analysts, and you will be learning all about them throughout this course!
