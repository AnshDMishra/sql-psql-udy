# Introduction

We'll primary focus on the parts of SQL used in Data Analysis.

For the example in this course we'll use data from **Parch and Posey**, a company that **sells paper**.

They have `50` **sales reps** spread across the US in `4` **regions**.

They sell `3` **types** of paper: `regular`, `poster` and `glossy`. Their clients are primarily large Fortune 100 companies whom they attract by advertising on Google, Facebook and Twitter.

Parch and Posey is not a real company.

The questions you'll answer using Parch and Posey's data are meant to simulate real world problems.

Using **SQL**, we will be able to help Parch and Posey answer tricky questions like,

- which of their product lines is worst performing?

- Which of their marketing channels they should make a great investment in?
